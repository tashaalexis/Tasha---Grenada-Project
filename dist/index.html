  <h1>Grenada: Small Island, Big Adventure</h1>

<p>
  Grenada is one of my favourite places to travel because it feels calm, warm, and full of life. It is known as the “Spice Isle” and you can really feel that when you visit markets and smell nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa in the air. Travelling around Grenada is easy to enjoy even if you want a simple trip: you can spend time at the beach, explore waterfalls, try local food, and still have a relaxed pace. I love how the island has beautiful scenery but also a friendly, community feel. Whether you want a quiet beach day, a hike, or a sunset view, Grenada gives you variety without feeling rushed. It is perfect for resetting your mind, taking photos, and making memories.
